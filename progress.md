Original prompt: [$develop-web-game](C:\\Users\\陆敬毅\\.codex\\skills\\develop-web-game\\SKILL.md) 复刻一款 steam 游戏，名字叫《super auto pets》

## 2026-02-12
- Initialized project from empty workspace.
- Will build a playable Super Auto Pets inspired web clone with canvas UI and deterministic test hooks.
- TODO: implement shop/team/battle loop.
- Implemented first playable build: menu -> shop -> battle -> next round loop.
- Added pets (ant/fish/beaver/cricket/mosquito/flamingo/camel/kangaroo) and food effects.
- Added controls: click interactions, right-click freeze, R/X/S/E shortcuts, F fullscreen.
- Added deterministic hooks: window.render_game_to_text and window.advanceTime(ms).
- Added local static server (server.js) and Playwright smoke actions (test/actions-smoke.json).
- Code review finding fixed: battle faint cleanup order was unsafe for summon-on-faint and could remove summons or loop; now remove dead unit before faint effects, and rear-target indexing adjusted.
- Tuned level-up threshold for level 3 from 5 to 3 exp to better match SAP behavior.
- Validation loop:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Playwright client runs now succeed via local copy fallback to installed Chrome channel.
  - Scenarios executed: battle-mid, shop-features (freeze/sell/food), round-complete, and explicit battle-screen capture.
  - No console/page errors in new runs.
- Visual inspection completed for latest screenshots:
  - shop UI renders correctly on desktop scale.
  - battle scene visible and consistent with state JSON (mode=battle, teams/log).
- Remaining TODOs / next iteration suggestions:
  - Add more pets/foods and exact SAP-trigger ordering for higher fidelity.
  - Add drag-and-drop UX and mobile-specific layout polish.
  - Add deterministic seeded enemy presets for repeatable balancing tests.
- Iteration 2 in progress:
  - Added player progression state (level/xp), tier unlock by progress, and scalable life loss by round.
  - Expanded pet pool and food pool with new abilities/effects.
  - Added one-battle food buffs and summon synergy hooks.
  - Implemented drag system scaffolding for shop interactions.
  - Next: run full Playwright validation and adjust visuals/text output.
- Validation (iteration 2) complete:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Playwright scenarios passed with no console/page errors:
    - iter2-shop
    - iter2-battle
    - iter2-round
    - iter2-targetless
    - iter2-food-battle
    - iter2-smoke (2 iterations)
- Visual review notes:
  - Shop, battle, and progression HUD (level/xp/tier) render correctly.
  - Tier unlock verified in smoke run: level reached 2 and tier switched to 2 with new tier-2 pets/foods.
  - Drag-capable UX message shown and sell target remains functional.
- Remaining follow-ups:
  - Add dedicated automated drag-path action payload (mouse-down/move/up granularity) when client supports persistent hold motion.
  - Tighten exact SAP trigger ordering and broaden pet roster.
- Added higher-fidelity triggers:
  - New pets: Peacock, Dodo, Penguin, Turtle.
  - New foods: Melon, Chocolate.
  - Added pet EXP helper and chocolate leveling path.
  - Added melon shield and extra start/end-turn trigger behaviors.
- Starting regression test batch now.
- Validation (iteration 3) complete:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Playwright scenarios passed with no console/page errors:
    - iter3-shop
    - iter3-battle
    - iter3-round
    - iter3-smoke (2 iterations)
    - iter3-exp-foods
- Visual review notes:
  - Battle screenshot confirms summon/faint chain still stable after new triggers.
  - Tier progression still unlocks higher-tier units/foods as expected.
  - New mid-tier pets (peacock/rabbit etc.) appear in shop at tier 2+.
- Follow-up TODO:
  - Add deterministic scenario payloads specifically targeting chocolate/melon/dodo/penguin triggers for stricter regression assertions.
  - Continue toward exact SAP priority queue ordering (currently close, not 1:1).

## 2026-02-13
- Iteration 4: trigger queue readability + deterministic scenario capture tuning.
- Fixed trigger noise in battle queue output:
  - Added `hasHurtBehavior` and `hasFaintBehavior` guards so only real hurt/faint abilities enqueue corresponding triggers.
  - Removed misleading trigger entries for pets without relevant hurt/faint behavior (e.g. beaver showing as fake faint/hurt trigger).
  - Standardized `triggerResolved` label formatting to `phase:side:actor [note]`.
- Improved battle observability:
  - Added explicit combat log line when Melon blocks damage.
  - Exposed `battle.resultTime` and `battle.resultHold` in `render_game_to_text` to aid deterministic capture timing.
  - Cleared scenario toast at battle start so battle logs are not visually obscured during scripted validation.
- Refined debug scenario presets for consistent signal:
  - `melon`: fish with melon vs high-attack beaver for guaranteed melon consumption.
  - `dodo`: front fish + dodo vs beaver stats adjusted for stable start-battle buff + trade sequence.
  - `turtle`: turtle/fish/horse vs beaver tuned for reliable turtle faint -> melon handoff before result.
- Updated scenario action timings:
  - `actions-scenario-melon.json`, `actions-scenario-dodo.json`, `actions-scenario-peng.json`, `actions-scenario-turtle.json`.
- Validation completed:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Scenario loop rerun to dedicated folders:
    - `scenario-choco-new`
    - `scenario-melon-new`
    - `scenario-dodo-new`
    - `scenario-peng-new`
    - `scenario-turtle-new`
  - Full regression batch rerun for all `test/actions-*.json` into `output/web-game/iter4-*`; no new console/page error artifacts produced in those iter4 folders.
  - Visual inspection completed for key screenshots:
    - Choco: fish level-up visible in shop.
    - Melon: melon shield consumption visible in battle log and perk removed.
    - Dodo: start-battle dodo buff visible before trades.
    - Penguin: end-turn buff reflected in fish combat stats.
    - Turtle: turtle faint gives melon to fish before follow-up trade.
- Remaining TODO / next iteration suggestions:
  - Add assertion script(s) over `state-0.json` for scenario runs to automatically check trigger/log invariants (currently manual inspection + JSON readback).
  - Continue moving toward closer SAP timing/order fidelity for multi-faint chain edge cases (simultaneous summons + layered hurt/faint cascades).

- Iteration 5: automated scenario assertions added (no longer manual-only verification).
- Added `scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs`:
  - Runs scenario actions (`choco/melon/dodo/peng/turtle`) via local `scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` using the current Node runtime (`process.execPath`).
  - Writes outputs under `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/<scenario>/`.
  - Fails on Playwright error artifacts (`errors-0.json`) and validates `state-0.json` invariants per scenario.
  - Supports optional filtering by scenario name args (example: `node scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs melon turtle`).
- Added npm script:
  - `test:scenarios` -> `node ./scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs`
- Validation completed:
  - `node --check scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs` passed.
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - `node scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs` passed all 5 scenarios.
  - Visual inspection completed for generated scenario assertion screenshots:
    - `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/choco/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/melon/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/dodo/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/peng/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/scenario-assertions/turtle/shot-0.png`
- Remaining TODO / next iteration suggestions:
  - Add one broader command that runs `test:scenarios` + the existing generic `actions-*.json` regression batch in one step.
  - Add assertion coverage for queue ordering details (`battle.triggerResolved`) in chained faint/summon edge cases.

- Iteration 6: one-command full regression pipeline added.
- Added `scripts/run_full_regression.mjs`:
  - Runs `run_scenario_assertions.mjs` first (5 deterministic scenario checks).
  - Then runs all non-scenario `test/actions-*.json` payloads through `scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`.
  - Writes outputs to `output/web-game/full-regression/<action-name>/`.
  - Fails on non-zero Playwright exit or generated `errors-0.json`.
  - Supports optional action file filter args (example: `node scripts/run_full_regression.mjs actions-smoke.json`).
- Added npm script:
  - `test:regression` -> `node ./scripts/run_full_regression.mjs`
- Validation completed:
  - `node --check scripts/run_full_regression.mjs` passed.
  - `node --check scripts/run_scenario_assertions.mjs` passed.
  - `node scripts/run_full_regression.mjs` passed:
    - scenario assertions: 5/5 pass
    - non-scenario action regressions: 8/8 pass
  - Filter mode validated:
    - `node scripts/run_full_regression.mjs actions-smoke.json` passed.
  - Visual inspection completed for latest regression screenshots:
    - `output/web-game/full-regression/actions-battle-screen/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/full-regression/actions-shop-features/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/full-regression/actions-round-complete/shot-0.png`
- Remaining TODO / next iteration suggestions:
  - Add queue-order assertions for chained edge cases (multi-faint + summon + hurt interleave) directly in scenario assertion script.
  - Consider refactoring shared Playwright runner helpers between `run_scenario_assertions.mjs` and `run_full_regression.mjs` to reduce duplication.

- Iteration 7: bilingual language switch (English/Chinese) implemented.
- Core i18n changes in `src/game.js`:
  - Added i18n dictionaries (`en` / `zh`) for UI text, toasts, and combat log templates.
  - Added display-name maps for pets and foods in Chinese (`PET_NAME_ZH`, `FOOD_NAME_ZH`).
  - Added helpers: `t`, `petDisplayName`, `foodDisplayName`, `perkDisplayName`, `foodEffectDisplayName`, `toggleLanguage`.
  - Added `state.language` (default `en`) and exposed it in `render_game_to_text`.
- Language switch UX:
  - Added visible language toggle button on top bar (`ui.languageBtn`) in shop/battle/gameover.
  - Added language toggle button on menu screen.
  - Added keyboard shortcut `L` to switch language in any mode.
  - Added toast feedback when language changes.
- Localized rendering scope:
  - Top bar pills, section headings, menu copy, battle headers, game-over copy, button labels.
  - Shop card text: pet/food names, level/exp labels, attack/health tokens, food effect labels.
  - Test preset labels and controls hint line.
  - Toasts and battle log entries now route through i18n keys.
- Added dedicated Playwright action for language switch:
  - `test/actions-language-toggle.json`
- Validation completed:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Targeted language toggle run passed:
    - output: `output/web-game/language-toggle/`
    - state confirms `"language":"zh"` and localized names/toast.
  - Full regression rerun passed after i18n changes:
    - `node scripts/run_full_regression.mjs`
    - scenario assertions: 5/5 pass
    - non-scenario actions: 9/9 pass (includes new `actions-language-toggle.json`)
  - Visual inspection completed for updated language UI:
    - `output/web-game/language-toggle/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/lang-layout-smoke2/shot-0.png`
    - `output/web-game/lang-layout-zh2/shot-0.png`
- Remaining TODO / next iteration suggestions:
  - Add persistence for language preference (localStorage) so reload keeps user-selected language.
  - Expand i18n into automated assertions (for example asserting critical Chinese labels after toggle).

- Iteration 8: language preference persistence implemented.
- Added localStorage persistence in `src/game.js`:
  - `LANGUAGE_STORAGE_KEY = "sap_clone_language"`
  - `persistLanguagePreference()` writes selected language on toggle.
  - `restoreLanguagePreference()` restores saved language at startup.
  - Startup now calls `restoreLanguagePreference()` before first render.
- Behavior:
  - Toggling via button or `L` still updates UI immediately.
  - Refreshing page keeps previously selected language (`en`/`zh`).
  - Storage failures (private mode / blocked storage) fail safely and keep default `en`.
- Validation completed:
  - `node --check src/game.js` passed.
  - Persistence verification script (Playwright + chrome channel) passed:
    - before reload: `storage=zh`, `language=zh`
    - after reload: `storage=zh`, `language=zh`
  - Full regression rerun passed:
    - scenario assertions: 5/5
    - non-scenario actions: 9/9
